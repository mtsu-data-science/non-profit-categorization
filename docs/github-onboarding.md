# GitHub Onboarding

## Overview

This project is going to be using GitHub for supporting collaboration for the project.  To submit work to the project, you will need to clone the repository to your local computer and create a branch.

## Steps

1. Download GitHub Desktop from [GitHub Desktop Download](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign into your GitHub account associated with the project.
3. Configure your git

7. To start on work, the first step will be to create a branch off of `main`.  You will do this by selecting the `Current Branch` drop down and type in the new branch name.  More descriptive branch names make it easier to find.
